# Haskell-String-Replacement - Original 

## ChatGPT-4o,Claude 


Write an executable Haskell program that runs without any error for the following question You are given a text file named example.txt 
containing some content. Your task is to implement a Haskell program that performs the following steps: Read the content of the file example.txt. 
Search for a specified target string in the file (case-insensitive). Replace all occurrences of the target string with a specified replacement 
string. Print the modified content after all replacements are done, without overwriting the original file. Requirements: Use Data.Text for 
efficient string manipulation (to handle large text efficiently). Perform case-insensitive search and replacement. 
Avoid manual character-by-character processing using tuple operations like zip or list-based operations.
Use appropriate Haskell library functions for string replacement. Define helper functions (like the case-insensitive replacement) at the
top level of the program, not inside another function's where or let block. This will ensure that you can add proper type signatures for
these helper functions. Type signatures can only be added to top-level functions. Pass the filename, target and replacement strings as
arguments from the command line.

Additional Notes:
Ensure that the catchIOError function is used to gracefully handle file I/O errors.
The function handling file reading errors must return T.Text (use T.empty for empty content) instead of Maybe T.Text to avoid type mismatches.
Consistently use Data.Text throughout the program to avoid mismatching types (T.Text vs. Maybe T.Text).
Handle edge cases like file not existing, file being empty, and target string being empty properly.
Use Data.Text functions such as T.toLower, T.replace, and T.isInfixOf for efficient case-insensitive string manipulation.

The correct way to handle IO errors now is to use the catch or try functions from the Control.Exception module
